            My name is Brett Hillman and I am a current software bootcamp student at Thinkful,
             with aspirations of becoming a full stack engineer in the near future. 
             I am currently based out of Orlando Florida area!</p>

            About Me!
        </h3>
        <p>
            Before becoming a Thinkful student I had a unusal background for becoming a software engineer, 
            I was a student at NCCC and graduated with a associates degree in criminal justice. After I graduated 
            and waited for a job in the criminal justice feild (which can take a very long time espcially in a little town like in Sanborn,NY)
            I became a insurance salesmen, which became very monotonus very quickly but it paid the bills espcially when you have two kids
            and a wife to take care of.
        </p>

            <p> 
            So I decided to take some free online classes 
            and watch some videos about software engineering and I fell in love with the challange and creativity of it all more then I ever imagined I would.
            That's when we decided we needed a change of scenery and moved to the home of the Mickey Mouse 
            and joined Thinkful so I could become a engineer and be proud of my work and challanged every day. When I was younger I always had an
            intrest in engineering so I figured software engineering would be a perfect match for me. 
       </p>
       
       <p>
           My other hobbies outside of engineering include:
           <ul>
               <li>Football: I'm a die hard Buffalo Bills fan and have played football starting at age 5 up untill college.</li>
               <li>Reading: I'm an avid reader, I'm usually into self development, and non fiction books.</li>
               <li>camping: nothing is more relaxing then getting out for a weekend with some friends by a campfire.</li>
           </ul>
       </p>
       <p>
